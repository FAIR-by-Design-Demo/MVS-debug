# Minimum Viable Skills for **Students**

There are two types of Minimum Viable Skills for students:


### Minimum Viable Skillset (MVS) for Undergraduates 

Addresses the minimum competencies and skills needed by undergraduate students at the completion of their degree program in Open Science (OS). The MVS profile for undergraduates considers that undergraduate students do not typically undertake extensive research projects. However, there are opportunities for undergraduates to interact with data and software whilst working on assignments. Therefore, this MVS for undergraduate students is a general profile developed specifically in regard to data literacy knowledge, as it serves as basis for relevant OS activities and knowledge of the FAIR principles. For information related to basic skills for graduate students who are undertaking research activities, typically via dissertations and other assignments, see the MVS designed for Master’s Students. For the basic skills and competencies needed for early career researchers, including postgraduate students (PhDs), please see the MVS for early career researchers.

## Minimum Viable Skillset (MVS) for Master’s students

Master’s level education is more specialised and focused than the undergraduate level. Subsequently, the MVS for Masters students considers the skills and competencies in Open Science (OS) as is needed for a more focused study, incorporating OS into their project workflows. This is a generic profile for students in postgraduate education.

For information related to basic skills for researchers, see the MVS designed specifically for *early career researchers*, which addresses the minimum skills and competencies needed for PhD student and post-doctoral researchers.
