	abstract     = {Data stewardship is a term that is understood in heterogenous ways. In recent organisational developments and efforts to build infrastructures and hire professional staff for research data management in various scientific fields in Europe, data stewardship is understood as mainly aiming at optimising data management in line with the FAIR principles (findability, accessibility, interoperability, reusability) forpurposes of reuse in the interests of the scientific community and the public. In addition, especially in the health and biomedical sciences some understandings of data stewardship mainly focus on the responsibility to respect the informational rights of data subjects. Following on from these different understandings and from recent developments to include ever more stakeholders in data stewardship, we propose a comprehensive understanding of data stewardship. According to this comprehensive understanding, data stewardship includes responsibilities towards all pertinent stakeholders and to equally consider and respect their legitimate rights and interests in order to build and maintain an efficient, trusted and fair data ecosystem. We also point out some of the practical challenges implied in such a comprehensive understanding.}

	abstract     = {Currently, data are stored in an always-on condition, and can be globally accessed at any point, by any user. Data librarianship has its origins in the social sciences. In particular, the creation of data services and data archives, in the United Kingdom (Data Archives Services) and in the United States and Canada (Data Library Services), is a key factor for the emergence of data librarianship. The focus of data librarianship nowadays is on the creation of new library services. Data librarians are concerned with the proposition of services for data management and curation in academic libraries and other research organizations. The purpose of this paper is to understand how the complexity of the data can serve as the basis for identifying the technical skills required by data librarians. This essay is systematically divided, first introducing the concepts of data and research data in data librarianship, followed by an overview of data science as a theory, method, and technology to assess data. Next, the identification of the competencies and skills required by data scientists and data librarians are discussed. Our final remarks highlight that data librarians should understand that the complexity and novelty associated with data science praxis. Data science provides new methods and practices for data librarianship. A data librarian need not become a programmer, statistician, or database manager, but should be interested in learning about the languages and programming logic of computers, databases, and information retrieval tools. We believe that numerous kinds of scientific data research provide opportunities for a data librarian to engage with data science.}
