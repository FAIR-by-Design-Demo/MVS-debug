abstract = {Data stewardship is a term that is understood in heterogenous ways. In recent organisational developments and efforts to build infrastructures and hire professional staff for research data management in various scientific fields in Europe, data stewardship is understood as mainly aiming at optimising data management in line with the FAIR principles (findability, accessibility, interoperability, reusability) forpurposes of reuse in the interests of the scientific community and the public. In addition, especially in the health and biomedical sciences some understandings of data stewardship mainly focus on the responsibility to respect the informational rights of data subjects. Following on from these different understandings and from recent developments to include ever more stakeholders in data stewardship, we propose a comprehensive understanding of data stewardship. According to this comprehensive understanding, data stewardship includes responsibilities towards all pertinent stakeholders and to equally consider and respect their legitimate rights and interests in order to build and maintain an efficient, trusted and fair data ecosystem. We also point out some of the practical challenges implied in such a comprehensive understanding.}
